<br />

I am a PhD student in the Department of Economics at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/economics/ucl-department-economics).

My research interest is in development economics, labour economics, and political economy. 


Prior to joining the UCL, I worked as a consultant at the World Bank, Poverty and Equity Global Practice. I received MA from Yale University, MSc from London School of Economics (LSE) and BA from the University of Tokyo.
