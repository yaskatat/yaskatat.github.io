## Working Papers
**When Refugees Become Natives: Intergenerational Assimilation of Palestinian Refugees in Jordan** <br/>
<span style="color: DarkGrey">[draft available upon request]</span>
This paper investigates the intergenerational persistence of a refugee-native gap by focusing on Palestinian refugees’ children in Jordan. Palestinians were displaced more than 50 years ago, and their children have already established themselves in their host country. While the majority of Palestinians in Jordan are granted Jordanian nationality, a fraction of them is registered as foreigners even if they were born and raised in Jordan. By exploiting this unique setting, this research aims to answer two questions: (1) To what extent do refugees assimilate with natives in low- or middle- income countries in the long run and over generations? and (2) How is the assimilation process influenced by immigration
policies of host countries? I particularly focus on education and labour market outcomes, as the
Jordanian government has implemented pro-refugee policies on the former, while discrimination
remains in the latter.

## Works in Progress

**Extreme Rainfall and Service Sector Vulnerabilities: Evidence from Frim Transactions in Uganda** (with Ryu Matsuura and Anton Reinicke) 
This paper explores the effect of extreme rainfall, an increasingly frequent event due to climate change, on firms' performance and their supply chains. Using rich administrative data of firm transactions in Uganda, we explore both the direct and indirect effects of extreme precipitation shocks, as well as the role of local demand.

**Job Creation and Wage Choice of Japanese Multinational Enterprises in Vietnam** (with Jonas Hjort, Yukiko Saito and Linda Wu)
How do multinational enterprises (MNEs) make decisions on employment and wages for their subsidiaries abroad? Firms that invest in developing countries often take advantage of wage gaps to reduce labour costs. However, little is known about how they adjust sourcing costs when low- or middle-income countries experience higher wage growth than high-income countries. We construct a comprehensive firm-level dataset that links Japanese headquarters with their Vietnamese subsidiaries. Leveraging quasi-experimental wage shocks in Vietnam, we explore the interplay of employment and wage dynamics among Japanese MNEs and their Vietnamese subsidiaries, as well as other MNEs and domestic Vietnamese firms.
